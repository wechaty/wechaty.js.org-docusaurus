If you are a total beginner to Wechaty, start from this section.

You can run Wechaty on following platforms:

- [Google Cloud Shell](../quick-start/running-on-google-cloud-shell.md)
- [Gitpod](../quick-start/running-on-gitpod.md)
- [Locally on your machine](getting-started/running-locally.mdx)

Wechaty is a RPA (Robotic Process Automation) SDK for Chatbot Makers which can help you create a bot in 6 lines of [JavaScript](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/wechaty), [Python](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/python-wechaty/), [Go](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/go-wechaty/), and [Java](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/java-wechaty/), with cross-platform support including [Linux, Windows, MacOS](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/actions?query=workflow%3ANPM), and [Docker](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/actions?query=workflow%3ADocker).

You can also watch the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZd42xxaTcI&list=PLkLKftrhFi7vfaADtPrGyuutbpcA_ppxE) below to get an introduction and demonstration of some of the capabilities and applications using Wechaty's getting-started repository.
